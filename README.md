# Econometrics Project - Healthcare

This was a group project done for a course requirement of ECO 321: Econometrics at Stony Brook University.
The group members are: Parv Joshi, Emirhan Akkaya, and Shail Shah.
This project was divded into two parts, namely project 1 and project 2.
Both projects use the same dataset (Final Clean Data - Usable Form.csv).
You can see the R code and the project essay for both parts, alongwith the common dataset and its documentation.

Our research question was to find the dependence of factors like a country’s standard of living, military expenditure, government savings, and government debt on a nation’s healthcare expenditure in standard years (non-recession years).
For the first part, we were reqired to perform basic multivariable regression to find a linear model.
The second question had the same question, but our focus was in using non-linear transformations (polynomial and log), interaction terms, and Instrumetal Variable (IV) Regression.
We could not find any good variable that would work as an instrument, hence we could not perform IV regression.
